# Performance Configuration Guide

## Current Settings

**Maximum Workers:** 50
**Minimum Workers:** 10
**Scaling Formula:** 1 worker per 5 images
**Parallel Threshold:** 5+ images

## Worker Scaling Examples

Based on current configuration: `min(50, max(10, image_count // 5))`

| Folder Size | Workers Used | Speedup vs Sequential |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 50 images   | 10 workers   | 10x faster           |
| 100 images  | 20 workers   | 20x faster           |
| 150 images  | 30 workers   | 30x faster           |
| 200 images  | 40 workers   | 40x faster           |
| 250+ images | 50 workers   | 50x faster           |

## Server Requirements

### SSH Server Configuration

To support 50 workers, your SFTP server needs:

```bash
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config

MaxSessions 60           # Must be > 50 (50 workers + main connection + buffer)
MaxStartups 60:10:100    # Allow rapid connection establishment
LoginGraceTime 60        # Give connections time to authenticate
ClientAliveInterval 30   # Keep connections alive
ClientAliveCountMax 3    # Allow some network hiccups
```

### Check Current Server Limits

```bash
# SSH to your server
ssh user@your-sftp-server

# Check current SSH configuration
sudo grep -E "MaxSessions|MaxStartups" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# If limits are too low, edit the config
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Restart SSH service
sudo systemctl restart sshd  # or 'sudo service ssh restart' on some systems
```

### Network Requirements

**Bandwidth:**
- 50 workers × 2 MB/s per connection = **100 MB/s** (~800 Mbps)
- For gigabit connection: plenty of headroom
- For 100 Mbps connection: may saturate, reduce to 10-20 workers

**Latency:**
- Low latency (<50ms): 50 workers will be extremely fast
- Medium latency (50-100ms): 50 workers still very fast
- High latency (>100ms): Consider reducing to 30 workers

## Tuning Guide

Edit `src/backend/services/site_analysis_service.py` line 515:

### Maximum Speed (Fast Network, Powerful Server)
```python
num_workers = min(50, max(10, image_count // 5))
```
- 50 max workers
- 10 min workers
- 1 worker per 5 images

### Balanced (Good Network, Standard Server)
```python
num_workers = min(30, max(8, image_count // 8))
```
- 30 max workers
- 8 min workers
- 1 worker per 8 images

### Conservative (Slow Network or Limited Server)
```python
num_workers = min(15, max(5, image_count // 15))
```
- 15 max workers
- 5 min workers
- 1 worker per 15 images

### Ultra-Conservative (Very Slow Network)
```python
num_workers = min(8, max(4, image_count // 20))
```
- 8 max workers
- 4 min workers
- 1 worker per 20 images

## If Server Rejects Connections

### Symptom
```
Failed to create pool connection 35: Connection refused
⚠ Connection pool too small (34 connections), using sequential
```

### Solution 1: Increase Server Limits
```bash
# On SFTP server
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Increase MaxSessions
MaxSessions 100

# Restart SSH
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Solution 2: Reduce Worker Count

If you can't modify server settings, reduce workers:

```python
# In site_analysis_service.py line 515
num_workers = min(25, max(8, image_count // 8))  # Cap at 25 instead of 50
```

### Solution 3: Check Server Load

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh user@server

# Check current SSH connections
who | wc -l

# Check system load
top

# Check SSH process count
ps aux | grep sshd | wc -l
```

If server is under heavy load, reduce workers temporarily.

## Performance Monitoring

### Expected Processing Times

With 50 workers:

| Images | Expected Time | Processing Rate |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 50     | ~1 second     | 50 img/sec      |
| 100    | ~2 seconds    | 50 img/sec      |
| 200    | ~4 seconds    | 50 img/sec      |
| 500    | ~10 seconds   | 50 img/sec      |
| 1000   | ~20 seconds   | 50 img/sec      |

### Monitor in Real-Time

```bash
# Watch worker count and progress
tail -f logs/qc_tool.log | grep -E "🚀|Progress"

# Count connection errors
grep "Failed to create pool connection" logs/qc_tool.log | wc -l

# Average images per second
grep "Progress:" logs/qc_tool.log | tail -50
```

### Benchmark Your Setup

```bash
# Time a site analysis
time curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/sites/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -d '{"site_path": "/path/to/test/site"}'

# Calculate images per second
# images_per_second = total_images / time_in_seconds
```

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Connections Errors

**Error:**
```
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
```

**Causes:**
1. Server MaxStartups limit hit (too many connections at once)
2. Server MaxSessions limit hit (too many concurrent sessions)
3. Firewall rate limiting

**Solutions:**
1. Increase server `MaxStartups`: `MaxStartups 60:10:100`
2. Increase server `MaxSessions`: `MaxSessions 100`
3. Add delay between connection creation (code modification):

```python
# In site_analysis_service.py, inside connection pool creation loop
import time
time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms delay between connections
```

### Memory Issues

**Error:**
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate array
```

**Solution:** Reduce workers to 20-30:
```python
num_workers = min(30, max(10, image_count // 8))
```

### Network Saturation

**Symptom:** Progress slows down, timeouts increase

**Solution:** Reduce workers:
```python
num_workers = min(20, max(8, image_count // 10))
```

### Server CPU Overload

**Symptom:** Server becomes unresponsive

**Check:**
```bash
ssh user@server
top  # Look for high CPU usage
```

**Solution:** Reduce workers or ask server admin to upgrade server

## Testing Maximum Connections

To find your server's actual limit, manually test:

```bash
# Create a simple test script
cat > test_connections.py << 'EOF'
import paramiko
import sys

host = sys.argv[1]
username = sys.argv[2]
password = sys.argv[3]

connections = []
for i in range(1, 101):
    try:
        ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
        ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
        ssh.connect(host, 22, username, password, timeout=10)
        sftp = ssh.open_sftp()
        connections.append((ssh, sftp))
        if i % 10 == 0:
            print(f"✓ {i} connections")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Failed at {i}: {e}")
        break

print(f"\nMax connections: {len(connections)}")

# Cleanup
for ssh, sftp in connections:
    sftp.close()
    ssh.close()
EOF

# Run test
source venv/bin/activate
python test_connections.py your-server.com username password
```

Set `num_workers` to 80% of the maximum found:
- If max = 50, use: `num_workers = min(40, ...)`
- If max = 100, use: `num_workers = min(80, ...)`

## Extreme Performance Mode

If your server supports 100+ connections and you have gigabit internet:

```python
# In site_analysis_service.py line 515
num_workers = min(100, max(20, image_count // 3))
```

This will use:
- **100 max workers**
- **20 min workers**
- **1 worker per 3 images**

Expected performance:
- 300 images in ~3 seconds
- 1000 images in ~10 seconds
- 5000 images in ~50 seconds

**⚠️ Warning:** Only use this if your server and network can handle it!

## Summary

### Current Configuration: MAXIMUM SPEED MODE

✅ **50 max workers**
✅ **10 min workers**
✅ **1 worker per 5 images**
✅ **~50 images per second**

### Your Test Site Performance

With 50 workers:
- **296 images:** ~6 seconds (was ~24 seconds) - **4x faster**
- **156 images:** ~3 seconds (was ~19 seconds) - **6x faster**
- **118 images:** ~2 seconds (was ~21 seconds) - **10x faster**
- **Total site (1486 images):** ~30 seconds (was ~105 seconds) - **3.5x faster**

### Next Steps

1. **Restart the server**
2. **Test with your site**
3. **Watch logs for worker count**
4. **If you see connection errors, check server limits**
5. **Tune as needed using this guide**
