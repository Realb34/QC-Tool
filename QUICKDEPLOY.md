### Step 1: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

```bash
cd "/Users/rileybellin/Desktop/QC TOOL WEB BASED"

2. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Web Service"**
3. Click **"Connect GitHub"** and authorize
4. Select your `qc-tool` repository
5. Render auto-detects `render.yaml` configuration
6. Click **"Create Web Service"**

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens Next

### First Access (Important!)

When you first visit your deployed app:

1. The app may take 30-60 seconds to "wake up" (free tier sleeps when inactive)
2. You'll see the login page
3. Enter your FTP/SFTP server credentials
4. Select your site
5. Browse and download files

### Important Notes

**Free Tier Limitations:**
- App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds
- 750 hours/month usage limit

**To Stay Always-On:**
- Upgrade to Render Starter plan ($7/month)
- In Render dashboard: Settings â†’ Plan â†’ Upgrade to Starter

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment Configuration

### Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS

After deployment, update your environment variable:

1. In Render dashboard, go to your service
2. Click **"Environment"** tab
3. Find `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (auto-created from render.yaml)
4. Update it if needed (default is set automatically)
5. Click **"Save Changes"**

The app will automatically redeploy with new settings.

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. In Render dashboard: **Settings** â†’ **Custom Domains**
3. Click **"Add Custom Domain"**
4. Enter your domain: `app.yourdomain.com`
5. Add CNAME record in your domain's DNS:
   - **Name**: `app`
   - **Value**: `qc-tool-XXXX.onrender.com`
6. Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)
7. Render automatically provisions SSL certificate

## ðŸ”„ Updating Your App

When you make changes to your code:

```bash
# Make your changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push

# Render automatically detects and deploys!
```

No manual deployment needed - Render watches your GitHub repo.

## ðŸ“Š Alternative: Railway.app

Slightly different approach, same ease:

1. Push code to GitHub (same as above)
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Sign up with GitHub
4. Click **"New Project"** â†’ **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. Select your repository
6. Railway auto-detects `railway.json`
7. Click **"Deploy"**

App live at: `https://qc-tool.up.railway.app`

**Pricing**: First $5/month free, then $5/month

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

**Check build logs in Render dashboard**

Common issues:
- Wrong Python version â†’ Check `runtime.txt`
- Missing dependencies â†’ Check `requirements.txt`
- Import errors â†’ Check `PYTHONPATH` in `render.yaml`

### App Crashes

**Check application logs in Render dashboard**

Common issues:
- Missing SECRET_KEY â†’ Auto-generated by Render
- Wrong start command â†’ Check `render.yaml`
- Port binding â†’ Should use `$PORT` environment variable

### Can't Connect to FTP

This is normal! The error is on your end:
- Verify your FTP server credentials
- Check server allows connections from Render's IPs
- Test with a public FTP server first
